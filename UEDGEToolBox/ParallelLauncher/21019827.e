/fusion/projects/boundary/guterlj/anaconda3/envs/uedge/lib/python3.8/site-packages/numpy/lib/npyio.py:528: VisibleDeprecationWarning: Creating an ndarray from ragged nested sequences (which is a list-or-tuple of lists-or-tuples-or ndarrays with different lengths or shapes) is deprecated. If you meant to do this, you must specify 'dtype=object' when creating the ndarray.
